# Resume Project

I have created a portfolio resume for the user centric development module milestone project. The content of the page was written by me.

## UX
It is my plan to convey my interest in web development from the front end to the back end. By showcasing my design of front-end web pages as well as the layout and structure of modern applications.

As a recruiter, I want to see the works and stylings of a junior developer, so that I can find potential candidates for a team.

### Existing Features
- Landing "page" - allows users to get to know my name and artistic preferences
...
- About featurette - allows users to learn more about my work history and skills
...
- Contact form - allows user to eventually email me directly from the page by filling out the provided form

### Features Left to Implement
- profile carosel - eventually I will implement a rotating carosel of projects that are hyperlinks to my works
Technologies Used

- send email - eventually I will implement the ability to send an email through the provided form

## Technologies Used
1. [Bootstrap grid system](https://getbootstrap.com)
    1.The project uses the grid and responsive layout of **bootstrap** 
2. [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    1.The project uses **JQuery** from getbootstrap.com to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
Testing was performed using the inpsect editor of google chrome for responsive layout and function on the IPad and IPhone X.

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    5. The email function does not work as of yet but is a planned imeplementation.
